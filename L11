Lesson 11 One good turn deserves another
I was having dinner at a restaurant when Harry Steel came in. Hurry worked in a lawer's office years, but he is now working at a bank. He gets a good salary but he always borrows moeny from his friends and never pays it back. Haryy saw me and came and sat at the same table. He has never borrowed money from me. While he was eating, I asked him lent me twenty pounds.To my surprised, he gave me the money immiediataly. 'I have never borrowed any moeny from you,' Harry said, 'so now you can pay for my dinner.'
