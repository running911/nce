Lesson48 Did you want to tell me something?
Dentists always ask questions when it is impossible for you to answer.
My dentist had just pulled out one of my teeth and had told me to rest.
I tried to say something but my mouth was full of cotton wool.
He knew I collected match box and he asked me whether my collecting are growing.
He then asked how my brother was and asked me wheter I liked my new job in London.
In answer to these questions, I either noded or made strage noises.
Meanwhile, my tongue was busy searching out the hole where the tooth had been.
I suddenly felt very worried, but I could not say anything. 
When the dentisy at last removed the cotton-wool from my mouth, I was able to tell him that had pulled the wrong tooth.
