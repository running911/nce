Lesson42 Not very musical
As we had had a long walk through one of the markets of old Delhi, we stopped at square to have a rest. 
After a time, we noticed a snake charmer with two large baskets at the other side of the square, so we went to have a look at him.
As soon as he saw us, he picked up a long pipe which was covered with coins and opened one of the backets.
When he began to play a tune, we had our first glimpse of the snake.
It rose out of the basket and fellowed the movements of pipe.
We were very much surprised when the snake charmer suddently began to play jazz tunes and moderm pop songs. 
The snake, however, continued to 'dance' slowly.
It obviously could not tell the diffence between Indian music jazz!
